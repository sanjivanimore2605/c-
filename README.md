To Execute the OOP(object oriented program):
In this program I have tried to write the object oriented program.
To make this program I have done some basic programming required for the c++ program.
At starting I have taken the header file with including the string.
Before main function I have taken the class student.
After class Ihave taken the main function and I have taken two objects (s1  and s2).
I have used(.)dot operatorto take  the input from class and after that I have given the require output.
At the last the program is completed by the returning the values to main function.
